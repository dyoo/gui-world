function-graph
---

Installation:  you'll need to sym-link the Dropbox/work/gui-world  as the "gui-world" collection, and run setup-plt afterwards so DrScheme knows about it.  Afterwards, restart DrScheme.


Usage: The Insert menu should have an "Insert Graph Function" item.  Running it should insert an Edit button; pressing Edit will drive the gui-world program.

You should be able to define functions as

   (define f <<Edit>>)

where <<Edit>> is the graphical snip.


Here are the known bugs:

    * Editing a graph-function does not properly notify DrScheme that the buffer has changed.

    * Low-level DrScheme namespacing issues exist; the structure types aren't being properly shared between gui-world and DrScheme.  So files saved with the snips can load, but you'll hit errors when trying to re-edit the function graph.
