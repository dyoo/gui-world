GUI-World: functional library for GUIs.


GUI-World is a PLT Scheme GUI library that allows one to write
graphical programs in the style of the World teachpack.  For example,

    (require (lib "gui-world.ss" "gui-world"))

    ;; show-message: world -> string
    (define (show-message w)
      (string-append "I see: " (number->string w)))

    ;; The world is a number, initially 0.
    (define initial-world 0)

    ;; The view is a message and a button to increment
    ;; the world.
    (define view (col (message show-message)
                      (button "Press me!" add1)))

    (big-bang initial-world view)


is a simple program that shows a message and a button for changing
the message's contents.


Installation:

    1.  Grab the sources from github.com.  The repository's home is in:

    http://github.com/dyoo/gui-world/tree/master


    For example:

       $ git clone git://github.com/dyoo/gui-world.git


    2.  Symbolically link the gui-world directory into the collects of
    your PLT Scheme installation.

    For example, if gui-world is under the home directory, and PLT Scheme
    under the ~/local/plt directory, then the command:

        $ ln -s ~/gui-world ~/local/plt/collects/gui-world

    will set up the necessary symbolic link.
