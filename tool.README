Installation: you'll need to sym-link the Dropbox/work/gui-world as
the "gui-world" collection, and run setup-plt afterwards so DrScheme
knows about it.  Afterwards, restart DrScheme.


Usage: The Insert menu should have an "Insert Graph Function" item.
Running it should insert an Edit button; pressing Edit will drive the
gui-world program.

You should be able to define functions as

   (define f <<Edit>>)

where <<Edit>> is the graphical snip.
