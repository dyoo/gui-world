* Support dialog as a toplevel gui element, so we can do
  alert-style dialog boxes.



Add more robust error trapping to the gvalueof and gcallback functions.


Figure out better names for the constructors.  (enabled/callback stuff is weird.)


Write documentation.

Make animations of the example programs.

Shriram asks: My question was whether you could use
your infrastructure to test ITSELF.  That is, you have written some
GUI world code to implement something -- a graph-drawing routine.  the
graph-drawing routine needs a test suite because all code needs test
suites.  As I've indicated above, a graph drawn with GUI world is
itself a test suite.  So, can you use the graph-drawing routine to
create a  test suite for the graph-drawing routine?

function-graph:

Investigate text rendering on dynamic text for gui-world.  Shriram says the following:
     Something is very broken w/ the text rendering.

         - After the first time, in creation mode, the text just says "Creating
         a new".

         - If I select a pair and click on "Change output", the "Updating the
         input" becomes "Updating the        .t" where "." is the right half of
         "u".

         I expect this is a general GUI-world problem that this example is
         exercising.  This is on Windows.
